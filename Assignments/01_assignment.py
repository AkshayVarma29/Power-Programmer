# Imagine the field is a 2D plane. Each cell is either water 'W' or a tree 'T'. 
# A forest is a collection of connected trees. Two trees are connected if they share a side i.e. if they are adjacent to each other.

# Your task is, given the information about the field, print the size of the largest forest
# Size of a forest is the number of trees in it. 
# If there are no forests in the field print -1.

# Input format:
# First line contains the size of the matrix N
# The next N lines contain N characters each, either 'W' or 'T' separated by space
# Read the inputs from the standard input stream

# Constraints: 1<=N<=350
